LEARNED TOPICS(26th DEC):
(Including hands-on coding & application development)

1. Agentic AI Fundamentals
Learned that AI agents are goal-driven, stateful systems that reason, act, and iterate
Understood how agents differ from single-prompt LLM interactions

2. Tool Calling & Function Calling
Learned how LLMs decide when to use tools instead of answering directly
Understood function calling as structured JSON output for safe automation

3. Multi-Step Reasoning
Learned how complex problems are solved using Reason → Act → Observe loops
Understood linear, branching, and iterative reasoning patterns

4. Planner–Executor & Supervisor Agents
Learned the Planner–Executor pattern for reliable multi-step execution
Understood how Supervisor Agents coordinate and evaluate multiple agents

5. Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent Systems
Learned when to use single agents vs multi-agent collaboration
Understood real-world use cases like copilots and research assistants

6. Agent Frameworks
Learned LangChain for LLMs, tools, memory, and agents
Understood when to use LangGraph, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and AutoGen

7. RAG (Theory + Coding)
Learned the full RAG pipeline: loading, chunking, embeddings, retrieval, generation
Built RAG using LangChain, Chroma, HuggingFace, and Groq LLMs

8. Application Development & Evaluation
Built a Streamlit-based conversational RAG application
Tested hallucination control, chunk size, retrieval depth, and edge cases
