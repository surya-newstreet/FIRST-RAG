MINUTE OF MEETING(17th DECS):
-------------------

- Reviewed overall system hierarchy and multi-tenant, multi-product architecture
- Discussed where and how product-level data should be stored and reused
- Clarified preconfig, config, and execution flow and their dependencies
- Talked about shared/common infrastructure for preconfig, config, and exec
- Reviewed scheduling, flow design, and e-commerce checks
- Discussed prompt enhancement and handling multiple applications
- Reviewed automation progress, completed and pending tasks
- Identified deployment and retrieval issues that need fixing
- Discussed DB creation rationale and improvements to DB structure

Learned Topics:-

Neural Networks
- Learned how neural networks automatically learn complex patterns by adjusting weights and biases
- Understood neurons as weighted sums with bias followed by activation functions

Neuron & Bias
- Learned the role of bias in shifting activation thresholds
- Understood how bias prevents dead neurons and enables learning with ReLU

Activation Functions
- Learned why activation functions introduce non-linearity
- Understood ReLU for hidden layers, Sigmoid for binary output, and Softmax for multi-class output

Network Architecture
- Learned the roles of input, hidden, and output layers
- Understood how depth and number of neurons affect model capacity

Forward Propagation
- Learned how data flows through layers to produce predictions
- Understood weighted sums followed by activation at each layer

Loss Functions
- Learned how loss quantifies prediction error
- Understood MSE for regression and cross-entropy for classification

Backpropagation
- Learned how errors are propagated backward through the network
- Understood how weights and biases are updated to improve accuracy
